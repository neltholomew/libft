# libft

## Description

**libft** is a personal C library project from 42's core curriculum. The goal
is to re-implement a set of standard C library functions from scratch,
along with a handful of additional helper functions and a small linked-list
toolkit, and package them into a single static library, `libft.a`.

This library becomes the base toolbox reused across later 42 projects,
so every function is written and tested with strict standards in mind:
no crashes, no segfaults, no memory leaks, and full compliance with the
42 Norm coding style.

## Instructions

Clone the repository and build the library with `make`:

```sh
git clone <repo-url> libft
cd libft
make
```

This compiles every `ft_*.c` source file with `cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror`
and archives the resulting object files into `libft.a` using `ar`.

Other available Makefile rules:

| Rule      | Effect                                             |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `make`    | Builds `libft.a`                                    |
| `make all`| Same as `make`                                      |
| `make clean` | Removes object files                             |
| `make fclean`| Removes object files and `libft.a`               |
| `make re` | `fclean` followed by a full rebuild                  |

To use the library in another project, include the header and link
against the archive:

```sh
cc your_program.c -I/path/to/libft -L/path/to/libft -lft -o your_program
```

```c
#include "libft.h"
```

## Detailed description of the library

The header `libft.h` declares the struct used by the linked-list part:

```c
typedef struct s_list
{
	void			*content;
	struct s_list	*next;
}	t_list;
```

| `ft_lstmap` | Creates a new list by applying a function to each node's content |

## Resources

- 42 Prague **Libft** subject PDF (`en.subject.pdf`) — the reference for
  every function's prototype and expected behavior.
- The C standard library man pages (`man 3 <function>`) for the behavior
  each `ft_*` function reproduces.

### How AI was used

I used Claude Code (Anthropic) as a study aid while working on this
project: asking it to explain concepts from the subject, clarify how a
libc function is expected to behave, and review my own implementations
for bugs, edge cases, and Norm issues. I have not used AI to write any
of the code in this repository directly — every `ft_*` function is my
own work.
